## Ã†lfric's Life of St. Edmund (ll. 137-58; MR 205-206)

Edmund the blessed, king of East Anglia, was wise and honorable and always honored the almighty God with noble practices. He was humble and virtuous and remained so resolute that he did not want to turn to shameful sins, and on neither side he declined his practices, but [he] was always mindful of the true teaching, 'are you appointed to [be] a leader? do not raise yourself, but be among men just as one of them.' He was generous with beggars and widows just as [_his_] father, and [he] always directed his people with benevolence towards righteousness, and [he] gave direction to the cruel [ones], and he lived blessed in the true faith.

Then at last it happened that the Danish people traveled with a fleet, ravaging and attacking far throughout the land, just as is their custom. In the ship [there] were the foremost leaders Hinguar and Hubba, united through the devil, and they landed in the land [of] Northumbria with spears, and devastated that land, and slew the people. Then Hinguar turned [to the] East with his ships, and Hubba remained in the land [of] Northumbria, having won the victory with cruelty. Then Hinguar came rowing to East Anglia, in the year that prince Alfred was twenty-one, he who later became famous, [the] king of [the] West Saxons; and the aforementioned Hinguar, just as a wolf, quickly stalked into the land, and attacked the people, men, women, and the ignorant children, and tormented to shame the innocent Christians.
