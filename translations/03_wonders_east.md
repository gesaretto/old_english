## Wonders of the East (HJ pp. 109-113)

A certain place is called Lentibelsinea, in which chickens -- like the ones that are among us -- are begotten of red color. If any man wishes to take them or to touch them at all, then they immediately burn up all his body. Those are a strange magic! Likewise, wild animals are then begotten in that place. The animals, when they hear the voice of man, then they flee far. The animals have eight feet and eyes of a witch and two heads. If any man wishes to meddle with them, then they set on fire their bodies. Those are strange animals! Likewise, half-hounds are similarly born in that place. They are called "cyno-cephali." These have manes of a horse and tusks of a boar and heads of a hound, and their breath is like the flame of fire.
