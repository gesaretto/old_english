## A Colloquy on the Occupations

### The Ploughman

- What do you say, ploughman? How do you practice your craft?
- Oh sir, I labor exceedingly! Every day I must go out at dawn. Then I must drive the oxen to the field and there yoke [them] to the plough. There is no winter so stark that I dared skulk at home: I do not dare for the eye of my master. But when I have yoked the oxen, and have fastened the plowshare and coulter to the plough, then I must plough a full acre [_cultivated field_] or more.
- Have you got any companion[_s_]?
- Yes, I have a servant: that [one] must urge the oxen with the goad. That [one] is now hoarse because of the chill and the shouting.
- What more [_else_] do you do? Have you got still more to do?
- Yes sir, I have much to do! I must fill the bin of the oxen with hay, and [give] water [to] them, and clean their stall.
- Oh, that is much toil!
- Yes lord, it is much toil, because I am not free.

### The Hunter

- Is this man one of your companions?
- Yes.
- Can you [do] any thing?
- I can [do] one craft.
- Which craft can you do?
- I am a hunter.
- Whose hunter are you?
- I am the king's hunter.
- How do you practice your craft?
- I weave nets for me [_myself_], and set them in a suitable place. Then I train my hounds [so] that they chase the wild animals, until they unawares come in [to] the nets. When they are thus captured, then I come up, and slay them in the nets.
- Can't you hunt without the nets?
- Yes, I can hunt without the nets.
- How?
- I catch the wild animals with swift hounds.
- Which wild animals do you catch the most?
- I catch deer, and roebucks, and boars, and sometimes hares.
- Were you on a hunt today?
- No, for that [_because_] it is Sunday; and yesterday I was on a hunt.
- What did you catch?
- I caught two deer and one boar.
- How did you catch them?
- I caught the deer in nets, and I stabbed the boar [to death].
- How were you so bold [_daring_] that you stabbed the boar?
- The hounds drove him to me, and I firmly withstood [him] there, and rapidly stabbed him with a spear.
- A hunter must not be timorous, because [_for that_] manifold wild animals live in [the] woods.
- Then you were very bold!
- What do you do after your hunt?
- I sell to the king as much as [_whatsoever_] I catch, because [_for that_] I am his hunter.
- What does he sell to you [_give you_]?
- He clothes me well and feeds me, and sometimes sells to me a horse or a ring, so that I practice my craft more eagerly.
