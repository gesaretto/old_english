# The Fall of Man (Genesis 3:1-19; ll. 21-42)

God called Adam, and said: 'Adam, where are you?' He said: 'I have heard your voice, my beloved, in Paradise, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself.' God said: 'Who said to you that you were naked, if you have not eaten of that tree which I have commanded that you ate not of?' Adam said: 'That woman that you gave me as companion, gave me of that tree, and I ate.' God said to that woman: 'Why did you do that?' She said: 'That snake deceived me, and I ate.'

God said to the snake: 'Because you did this, you are cursed among all beasts and wild beasts. You will go on your breast and eat the earth for all the days of your life. I establish an enmity between you and that woman and your offspring and her offspring; she will break your head and you will plot against her heel.'

To that woman God also said: 'I will multiply your miseries and your childbearing; in pain you will bring forth children and you are under man's authority and he will control you.' To Adam he said: 'Because you have heard the voice of your wife and you have eaten of that tree, which I commanded to you that you ate not, the earth is cursed in your deed; in hardships you will eat of the earth for all the days of your life. She will bring forth to you thorns and brambles, and you will eat the herbs of the earth. In the sweat of your face you will eat your bread, until you return to the earth, of which you were taken, because you are dust and to dust will return.'
