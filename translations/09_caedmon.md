## CÃ¦dmon's Hymn

Now we must praise the guardian of heaven, the power of the measurer and his purpose, the work of the father of glory; thus he, the eternal lord, established the foundation of each of the wonders.

Then, afterwards, the guardian of Mankind, the eternal lord, the almighty master, adorned the middle earth, the earth to the people.
